# ios-calc
My first iOS application - calculator.

Instead of creating a calculator with only basic arithmetic operations, I challenged myself to do it
with RPN - Reverse (postfix) Polish Notation. It was a good experience for me, but sometimes the code
looked strange... :disappointed_relieved:

The app had some advantages:
1. Lightweight controller
2. The base logic was splitted and stored in separated classes
3. Responsive intervace

.. and also, some disadvantages :disappointed_relieved: :
1. Sometimes strange way of realization some of functionality
2. There were some problems with naming of methods, variables etc., according to English rules and
Swift code style

The project was bootstrapped with Swift 3.0
